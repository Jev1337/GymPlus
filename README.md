## About The Project

![Screen Shot]( src/main/resources/assets/images/gymplus.png)


## Getting Started

You just have to clone the Repo and run, make sure to install the Prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* JavaFX [https://openjfx.io/](https://openjfx.io/)
* Symphony [https://symfony.com/](https://symfony.com/)
* MySQL via XAMPP [https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

## Usage

The only thing you need to do is to run the project and you are good to go. One note however is that in order to create an Admin account you have to create a Member account with the sign up
then change the role in the database to Admin. This is a temporary solution and will be fixed in the future.
